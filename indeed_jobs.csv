"Machine Learning Researcher
- job post",Longshot Systems Ltd,London EC1N•Hybrid work,"
At Longshot Systems we’re building advanced platforms for sports betting analytics and trading.
We're hiring for Machine Learning Researcher roles within our horse racing team, although prior knowledge of horse racing isn’t required. The primary goal of this team is to improve the predictive power of our models based on fundamental data about horse races. The quality of our models is incredibly important to us and this team has a high impact on the overall success of the company.
You will work closely with the CEO, CTO, and Team Lead to design, test, and implement new machine learning models in Python, continually improving our existing state-of-the-art solutions. Due to us being a small startup the role suits someone who wants to be involved in all aspects of the R&D process, from high-level design through to production implementation.
The ideal candidate will be highly creative and enjoy generating new, innovate ways to tackle problems and suggesting improvements to existing methodologies; you'll have a high level of autonomy to research whichever methods you felt would be best suited to the problem at hand. A strong mathematical understanding of the fundamentals of Machine Learning and core Statistics is very important for this role and ideally you'll have experience in doing research on cutting-edge models either in industry or academia.
We are a remote-first company, and for this role, we are open to both hybrid candidates—working one day a week in our Farringdon, London office—and fully remote candidates, though we prefer hybrid when possible. Our typical working hours are 10 am to 6 pm UK time, Monday to Friday, but we support flexible working and trust our team to manage their own schedules to meet their goals.
We're open to applicants across a range of experience levels applying to this role with a preference for more experienced / senior hires. Our interview process is as follows:

A 60 minute technical interview with our CEO and/or Team Lead, discussing your previous experience and also discussing some modelling scenarios and how you'd approach them
A one day 10am-6pm assessment day, where you'll be tackling a real modelling problem using data very similar to what we use in practise

Requirements
 Essential Skills

Very strong mathematical intuition and creativity.
Experience across a broad range of Machine Learning and Statistics. The intuition and experience to select the right approach to novel problems and understand the trade-offs involved in that approach as well as understanding the mathematical background to the solution chosen.
A practical, pragmatic approach to research and development; experience in taking ideas from concept stage through to production environments.
Experience using a range of Machine Learning software frameworks in Python
Passionate about learning new skills and techniques. Comfortable finding and reading academic papers to generate new research ideas.

Desired Skills

Relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Maths, Statistics, Machine Learning etc
Experience in Kaggle or similar competitive modelling projects or competitions
Software development experience

We encourage you to apply even if you think you may not currently fit all of these requirements – so long as you are willing to work hard and learn, we want to hear from you.
 Benefits
Our salary range for the role is £100,000 to £180,000, depending on experience and interview performance.
List of benefits for UK staff (may differ for international/remote applicants):

Participation in the company bonus scheme, typically 10-30% of salary depending on experience.
10% matched pension contributions
Private healthcare insurance
Long term illness insurance
Gym membership

Choose your own hardware & setup for your development environment. Adjustable standing desks provided

"Junior Data Scientist
- job post",PeckwaterBrands,London•Hybrid work,"

  We are a virtual food franchising company who build franchises for restaurants to operate on delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just eat. We work with over 500 restaurants across the UK, Germany and France to prepare market leading food propositions. We also work closely with delivery platforms to optimise marketing, merchandising and pricing - ensuring our brands are well presented and our marketing spend maximises ROI.
 


 We raised over £22MM in series A funding, and are now scaling operations to achieve profitability over the next 6 months. As we scale, we are driving a dual focus on (1) automation and (2) brand and product quality. This dual focus is key to us unlocking profitability, and making sure we deliver food that customers love.
 


 We are passionate about delivering fantastic products to our customers, and supporting these with market leading brands.
 


 This role will report directly into the eCommerce and Supply Chain director. It will focus on automating reports to support buying decisions, and monitor restaurant level compliance with our supply chain.
 


 How does our supply chain work?


  Broadly speaking, Peckwater places bulk ingredients orders from large wholesalers who deliver into our distributors. Our estate of restaurant partners then place orders from these distributors for the ingredients they need to make our food brands.
 


 The Problem


  We do not have an automated way of monitoring restaurant partner buying activity, and thus can't determine the level of compliance with our supply chain. Instead, we run manual processes to flag ""bad actors"" who may be buying their ingredients from other, poorer quality, sources. This is the biggest challenge to us delivering great quality food to our customers, and driving our ratings performance on delivery platforms.
 
The Role:

Pipeline inventory level data into quicksight to enable reporting on our stock levels
Build a reporting dashboard that indicates when new orders to our suppliers need triggering. This should set minimum re-order thresholds based on ""weeks of cover""
Pipeline purchasing data from our restaurant partners to enable a quick view on partner level supply chain compliance.
Build automated 'compliance reporting' to highlight non compliant partners for our account management team to take action on.
