This follows the award of a UKRI Grant to Investigators Mike Cates, Rob Jack, and Ronojoy Adhikari.
The Project is titled Nucleation and Extinction in Non-equilibrium Statistical Field Theories. It aims to create a non-equilibrium analogue to classical nucleation theory (CNT) for statistical field theories. In CNT the nucleation rate for a transition between phases is calculable from the free energy barrier corresponding to a critical nucleus. For non-equilibrium nucleation problems, such as phase transitions in an active fluid, no free energy exists and there is no general counterpart to CNT. Other such problems include the nucleation of an invading species in a new environment and the noise-induced transition between different flow patterns in a driven fluid. A closely related problem class is when noise leads to the extinction of an otherwise stable population, gene, or behavioural trait.",,"Cambridge, East of England, England",--,10000+ Employees

We envision a world where people communicate across vast distances so our roles focus on developing user-friendly tools for expressive character creation and animation. Our internships are twelve (12) to twenty four (24) weeks long and we have various start dates throughout the year.Research Topics:* Character animation synthesis, editing, retargeting, and stylization* Hand drawn figure analysis, manipulation, and generation* Reinforcement learning and physics-based control for character animation* Efficient and realistic physics simulation and modeling of human motion* Novel input and interfaces for motion synthesis, control, and editing* Evaluation of avatar systems* Human motion reconstruction, prediction, and analysis















Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology. People who choose to build their careers by building with us at Meta help shape a future that will take us beyond what digital connection makes possible today—beyond the constraints of screens, the limits of distance, and even the rules of physics.
